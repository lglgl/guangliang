A visionary pseudo-programmer, he once pulled network cables, fixed computers, moved servers, and wrote code. Now, he is lost, the path ahead is vast, yet he knows not where to go.

### 1.His vision of life:
Aspiration in morality: Upright under the heavens
Life expectations: Advancing in dignity, retreating with grace
Life ideals: Self-sufficiency in poverty, benevolence in prosperity
Life dreams: Family, wealth, and self-realization

### 2.About end-of-life care:
An elderly person under the sunset, a career under the sunrise. If there truly is a heaven, I would willingly become the angel escorting souls to paradise.

End-of-life care is a branch of humanities and social sciences, born out of personal interest. From a young age, passionate about politics, but constrained by a humble family background, I could only devote my spare time to this pursuit.

The future aging society issue will inevitably fall on the shoulders of the post-90s generation. In this matter, whether for family or society, I hope to be more professionally equipped.

I believe in emotional support and respect for the elderly. While financial conditions are supplementary, the time spent with loved ones is fundamental. Our parents raised us; why can't we care for them in their old age?

### 3.About urban planning:
If one doesn't know where they come from, how can they discuss where to go?
Maoming, my hometown, a magical place. Located in western Guangdong, apart from GDP, it has nothing to surpass its brother Zhanjiang. Yet, it doesn't hinder its economic interception of Zhanjiang.

Riding through the world with a smile, you may not know Maoming, but you can't be unfamiliar with lychees; you may not know Maoming, but you can't be unfamiliar with Maoming Petrochemical. This city, famous for petroleum and lychees, started planning in 2008, began construction in 2012, and now has a preliminary urban framework.

Situated at the intersection of Hainan Free Trade Zone, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Beibu Gulf Economic Zone, it is positioned as a transportation hub with three centers. Its future is yet to be determined.

Agriculture is its backbone. Gaozhou lychees, Huazhou oranges, Xinyi Sanhua plums, Shuidong mustard greens; bananas, longans, and tilapia are all its children.

### 4.About career planning:
Career planning is part of life planning. The world is perilous; without prior planning, where will you find a more beautiful landscape?

### 5.About marital values:
I hope to find someone to share the rest of my life with. Without the constraints of the mundane, we can fulfill our life pursuits together, where you prioritize family and I focus on a career, or vice versa.
You need not be erudite, but you should have something you love and persist in.
You need not be considerate, but you should bear responsibility and show understanding.
You need not have a global perspective, but you should maintain an exploratory outlook on the world.

### 6.About the elderly and children:
Children need companionship, and so do the elderly.
In my vision of family, your parents must be treated as mine. If either set of parents needs care due to illness, even with savings, I hope one of us can set aside work to care for them wholeheartedly.
